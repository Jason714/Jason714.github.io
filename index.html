                    Hello! My name is Jason Blake. I have nearly 20 years experience in the food &
                    beverage/hospitality industry (Over 11 years in family owned pizzerias. Also over
                    7 years in a multi-million dollar dining cruise corporation, 3 of those as the
                    Food & Beverage manger of one of their many locations). I'm currently a driver
                    with Uber while attending the coding bootcamp at UCI.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    In my free time I enjoy art, music and the outdoors. A few of my favorite genres
                    of music are techno, house and breakbeat. Psychedelic and Graffiti art are very
                    interesting to me because of their vibrancy and multitude of styles. Hiking in the
                    Angeles National Forrest is my prefered way to decompress from the hustle and bustle
                    of life in a big city.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    I hope this gives some insight about me. Feel free to ask me any questions or to just chat it up.
